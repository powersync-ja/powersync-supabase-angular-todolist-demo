# PowerSync with Superbase Angular Todo Demo

## Quick Start

1. Run `pnpm install`
2. Run `pnpm watch` to build application and check for code changes
3. In a new terminal run `pnpm start` to start the server
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080>

**Note:** The Angular development server (pnpm serve) doesn't support service worker applications

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
