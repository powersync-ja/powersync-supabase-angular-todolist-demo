# PowerSync + Supabase Angular Demo: Todo List

## Note: Alpha Release

This demo is currently in an alpha release.

## Overview

Demo app demonstrating use of the [PowerSync SDK for Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/powersync-sdk-web) together with Supabase.

A step-by-step guide on Supabase<>PowerSync integration is available [here](https://docs.powersync.com/integration-guides/supabase).

## Quick Start

1. Run `pnpm install`
2. Run `pnpm watch` to build application and check for code changes
3. In a new terminal run `pnpm start` to start the server
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080>

**Note:** The Angular development server (`pnpm serve`) doesn't support service worker applications

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further Help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
